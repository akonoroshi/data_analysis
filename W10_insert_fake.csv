But how I feel about the prompts is that when you ask the student to answer both right and wrong about each of the prompts it can seem overwhelming to do, especially for a m/c question that isn't necessarily supposed to take a long time. However, it is important to think about these questions when a student is in the learning process, so that is why I broke up the one prompt into two prompts. The first question gets the student narrow down the choices.

Such as: / - What is something that seems wrong in each of these code examples? / Then if the student still doesn't answer, then follow up with: / - What is something that is correct in each of these code examples? /  /  / I'm not sure if this would actually help? But how I feel about the prompts is that when you ask the student to answer both right and wrong about each of the prompts it can seem overwhelming to do, especially for a m/c question that isn't necessarily supposed to take a long time. However, it is important to think about these questions when a student is in the learning process, so that is why I broke up the one prompt into two prompts. The first question gets the student narrow down the choices.  The second question asks the student is the code example doing what it is supposed to be doing? /  / I'm not sure if the ordering of the prompts is the best ordering, but I would rather see the prompt be broken down into two because having to do so much just for one questions seems too tedious.",14.526,116.691,7.791,27,1,1,5.0,1,6.0,1,8.0,1,6.0,1,,,,Idk,,No,3.707,,8.065,0,1,,,10.7,49.008,98.387,7,4,2,7,3,,FL_19,Hammad Q|signup for wellness study|FL_25,Q72|Q111|Q114|Q35|Q36|Q96|prompt1helpful|prompt1respond|Q97|prompt2helpful|prompt2respond|Q98|prompt3helpful|prompt3respond|Q99|prompt4helpful|prompt4respond|Q100|prompt5helpful|prompt5respond|Q101|prompt6helpful|prompt6respond|Q102|prompt7helpful|prompt7respond|Q56|Q47|Q48|Q49|Q22|Q15|Q119,Q50|Q60|motivate1|Q110|motivate2|Q61|motivate3|Q62|motivate4|Q63|Q52|Q54|Q51|Q114|Q55|Q53|Q120,Q26|Q28|Q121,,,-1,,0,0,0,0

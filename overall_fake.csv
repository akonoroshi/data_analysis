But how I feel about the prompts is that when you ask the student to answer both right and wrong about each of the prompts it can seem overwhelming to do, especially for a m/c question that isn't necessarily supposed to take a long time. However, it is important to think about these questions when a student is in the learning process, so that is why I broke up the one prompt into two prompts. The first question gets the student narrow down the choices.

However, it is important to think about these questions when a student is in the learning process, so that is why I broke up the one prompt into two prompts. The first question gets the student narrow down the choices.

The first question gets the student narrow down the choices.
